This is my sequencer project. The goal of this project is to be able to generate MIDI sequences which resemble a series of improvised notes
which you might hear a musician play in a guitar solo. I was inspired to do this because I love using arpeggiators and sequencer functions
to create songs but I felt they just never had the depth or playability that I wanted. Ideally this sequencer would be "playable" and
by playing with the knobs you could generate a unique series of MIDI notes to send to your favorite DAW/VST/Eurorack setup.
